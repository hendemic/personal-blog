# Claude Code Development Guide

This document contains information to help Claude Code assist with development of this project.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: Strapi application (submodule connected to Railway)
  - Postgres database hosted on Railway
  - Environment variables managed through Railway
  - GraphQL plugin enabled
  - Digital Ocean Spaces for media storage

- **Frontend**: Nuxt.js application
  - Vue 3 based frontend
  - Connects to Strapi API

## Development Environment

- Docker Compose setup for local development
- The project uses the production Railway database directly in development
- Project uses Yarn as the package manager (not npm)

## Common Commands

### Docker

```bash
# Start the development environment
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Rebuild containers
docker compose build

# Stop containers
docker compose down
```

### Backend (Strapi)

```bash
# Access Strapi container
docker compose exec backend sh

# Install a new package
docker compose exec backend yarn add <package-name>

# Run Strapi CLI commands
docker compose exec backend yarn strapi <command>
```

### Frontend (Nuxt)

```bash
# Access Nuxt container
docker compose exec frontend sh

# Install a new package
docker compose exec frontend yarn add <package-name>
```

## Configuration Files

- `.env` - Contains environment variables (not committed to git)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration
- `backend/Dockerfile.dev` - Dockerfile for Strapi development (uses Node 20.12.2)
- `frontend/Dockerfile.dev` - Dockerfile for Nuxt development

## Digital Ocean Spaces Configuration

Required environment variables for Digital Ocean Spaces:
- `DO_SPACE_ACCESS_KEY` - Digital Ocean Spaces access key
- `DO_SPACE_SECRET_KEY` - Digital Ocean Spaces secret key
- `DO_SPACE_ENDPOINT` - Digital Ocean Spaces endpoint (e.g., 'nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com')
- `DO_SPACE_BUCKET` - Digital Ocean Spaces bucket name
- `DO_SPACE_REGION` - Digital Ocean Spaces region (e.g., 'nyc3')
- `DO_SPACE_BASE_URL` - (Optional) CDN URL if configured

## Notes for Claude

- This is a personal blog project
- The backend is a git submodule connected to Railway
- The project uses production database in development (personal choice for this project)
- When testing, make sure to use a local test data approach rather than affecting production data
- IMPORTANT: Project uses Yarn instead of npm for all package management

## GraphQL Schema Reference

This project uses Strapi v5 with GraphQL. Here are reference queries for common operations:

### Posts Queries

#### Basic Posts Query (for listing)

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    title
    description
    publishDate
    slug
  }
}
```

#### Complete Posts Query with Dynamic Content Zones

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    title
    slug
    description
    publishDate
    publishedAt
    updatedAt
    content {
      __typename
      ... on ComponentContentBlockHeadingBlock {
        heading
        level
      }
      ... on ComponentContentBlockTextBlock {
        text
      }
      ... on ComponentContentBlockMediaGrid {
        images {
          caption
          image {
            url
            alternativeText
          }
        }
      }
      ... on ComponentContentBlockImageBlock {
        caption
        image {
          url
          width
          height
          alternativeText
          formats
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Landing Page Query

```graphql
query {
  landingPage {
    Title
    Description
  }
}
```

### Important Notes on GraphQL in Strapi v5

- Response format is flattened compared to v4 (no data/attributes nesting)
- Dynamic Zones require explicit type selection with fragments
- Media fields need nested selection of properties (url, width, etc.)
- Always check field names in GraphQL playground before writing queries
- Do NOT include `id` field in queries - it's not directly accessible in this schema
- Use the GraphQL playground at http://localhost:1337/graphql to test queries
- Check the "Docs" tab in GraphQL playground to see the exact schema structure

## Development Workflow

### GraphQL Implementation Process

When implementing new GraphQL queries:

1. First draft the query in isolation
2. Test the query in the GraphQL playground at http://localhost:1337/graphql before implementing in code
3. Have the user confirm the query works as intended
4. Only after confirmation, implement the query in the application code
5. Document any new queries in this file for future reference
